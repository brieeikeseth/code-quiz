## Code Quiz 
For the quiz application assignment, we used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Javascript plays a huge role is this project which provides quiz questions and collect user data to determine whether the answers to a question are correct or not. Then generating a score and bringing you to the end page where results from the user data can be found. 

## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
